   - It helps catch errors during development.
   - It provides better code completion and documentation.

3. Vite is a modern frontend build tool.
   - It offers fast development server with hot module replacement.
   - It uses ES modules for faster builds.

4. Express is a minimal web application framework for Node.js.
   - It's used to build web applications and APIs.
   - It supports middleware for extending functionality.

5. PDF parsing is done using the pdf-parse library.
   - It extracts text content from PDF files.
